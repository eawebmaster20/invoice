- **Security**: Helmet, CORS

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd invoice-server
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials
```

4. Set up MySQL database:

- Create a new database named `invoice_db` (or your preferred name)
- Update the database configuration in `.env`

5. Start the server:

```bash
# Development mode with auto-restart
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

## Environment Variables

```env
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=invoice_db
DB_PORT=3306
DB_RESET=false

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
API_SECURE=true

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_change_this_in_production
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h

# Bcrypt Configuration
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
```

### Database Configuration

- **`DB_RESET`**: Controls database table management at startup
  - `false` (default): Tables are created if they don't exist
  - `true`: **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: All existing tables will be dropped and recreated on startup
  - Use with caution as this will **permanently delete all data**

### API_SECURE Configuration

The `API_SECURE` environment variable controls whether authentication and validation are enforced:

- **`API_SECURE=true`** (default): Full security enabled

  - JWT token authentication required for protected routes
  - Request validation enforced
  - Recommended for production environments

- **`API_SECURE=false`**: Development mode with bypassed security
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: Authentication and validation are completely bypassed
  - All protected routes become accessible without tokens
  - Mock user (`userId: 1`) is automatically injected
  - Should **ONLY** be used for development and testing
  - Server will display security warnings on startup

## Database Schema

The server automatically creates the following tables with their relationships:

### Tables

- **`users`** - User accounts and authentication
- **`bill_from_addresses`** - Company billing addresses (belongs to users)
- **`clients`** - Client information (global, not user-specific)
- **`invoices`** - Invoice records (belongs to users and clients)
- **`invoice_items`** - Line items for invoices (belongs to invoices)
- **`payment_details`** - Payment method information (belongs to clients and invoices)

### Key Relationships

- **Users** can have multiple **Bill From Addresses**
- **Users** can create multiple **Invoices**
- **Clients** are global entities (not tied to specific users)
- **Invoices** belong to both a **User** (creator) and a **Client** (recipient)
- **Invoices** can have multiple **Invoice Items**
- **Payment Details** belong to both **Clients** and **Invoices**
- **Invoices** include status tracking (pending, paid, partially_paid, overdue) and amount_paid

### Invoice Status Management

Invoices support the following statuses:

- `pending` - Default status for new invoices
- `paid` - Invoice has been fully paid
- `partially_paid` - Invoice has been partially paid
- `overdue` - Invoice is past due date

Each invoice tracks the `amount_paid` separately from the total amount.

## Security Features

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token authentication
- SQL injection protection with parameterized queries

## Error Handling

The API returns consistent error responses:

```json
{
  "error": "Error type",
  "message": "Detailed error message"
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:

- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created
- `400` - Bad Request (validation errors)
- `401` - Unauthorized (authentication required)
- `403` - Forbidden (invalid token)
- `404` - Not Found
- `409` - Conflict (duplicate data)
- `500` - Internal Server Error

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- MySQL 8.0+
- npm or yarn

### Scripts

- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with auto-restart

### Testing

You can test the API using tools like:
